WEEK 1: GETTING STARTED
Hello and welcome to the first week of Academic and Professional Communications for students of Humanities. If you are a Built Environment student (planning to study Architecture, Construction Management, Interior Architecture or Urban Planning), please find the separate guides designed specifically for you in the Study Materials folder on the unit Bb site. We hope you find it a challenging and valuable unit to support your studies at university.

This week you will look at the basics of communication and how this unit is structured. This study guide is set up to help you get started, and to understand the way in which this online unit will be run.

Note: These study guides have been created as interactive documents. Where you see words in orange and underlined, you will be able to press CTRL and click to jump to that part of the guide or to follow the link to a webpage.
